<H3 id="komal">THE GRAND PALACE</H3>
<center><img src="k1.jpg"></center>
<STRONG><b><H4 id="KOMAL1">The construction of the Grand Palace started in 1782 when the capital of Siam was moved from Thonburi to Bangkok.<br><br> 
The palace served as the residence of the Kings of Thailand until the mysterious death of King Ananda Mahidol in 1946.<br><br>
 His brother King Bhumibol Adulyadej who succeeded him moved permanently to the Chitralada Palace.<br><br>
 The Grand Palace covers a wide range of architectural styles, ranging from a pure Ayutthayan style of the temples <br><br>
 to a blend of Thai and Western for later structures. <br><br>It also includes the Wat Phra Kaew, home to the Emerald Buddha, <br><br>
 one of the oldest and most famous statues of the Buddha in the world.</b></strong></H4><br><br>
 
 <H3 id="komal">RAILAY</H3>
 

 <center><img src="thailand2.jpg"></center>
<STRONG><B><H4 id="KOMAL1">.Railay beach (or Rai Leh) is a small peninsula that is only accessible by boat due to the high<BR><BR>
 limestone cliffs cutting off mainland access.<BR><BR>
 These cliffs attract rock climbers from all over the world, but the area is also a popular attraction in Thailand <BR><BR>
 due to its beautiful beaches and quiet relaxing atmosphere.<BR><BR> Accommodation ranges from inexpensive bungalows popular with backpackers and climbers,<BR><BR>
 to the renowned jet-set resort of Rayavadee.</strong></B></H4><br><br>
 
 <H3 id="komal">KO PHI PHI</H3>
 

 <center><img src="thailand3.jpg"></center>
<STRONG><B><H4 id="KOMAL1">Ko Phi Phi is a small archipelago in the Krabi Province in Southern Thailand.<BR><BR>
 Ko Phi Phi Don is the largest island of the group, and is the only island<BR><BR>
 with permanent inhabitants while the smaller Ko Phi Phi Leh is very popular as a beach or dive excursion.<BR><BR>
 Tourism on Ko Phi Phi has exploded only very recently, especially after Ko Phi Phi Leh <BR><BR>
 was used as a location for the 2000 movie The Beach.<BR><BR>
 As a result of the masses of tourists Ko Phi Phi is becoming less and less attractive but for now it is still a very beautiful place to visit..</B></strong></H4><br><br>
