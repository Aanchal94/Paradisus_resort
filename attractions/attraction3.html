<STRONG><b><H4 id="KOMAL1">Situated on the banks of the River Thames, the London Eye is an enormous,<br><br>
 135 meter (443 ft) high observation wheel carrying 32 exterior glass-walled capsules.<br><br>
 It offers fantastic views over central London.<br><br> The wheel does not usually stop to take on passengers as the rotation rate<br><br>
 is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level.<br><br>
 It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually..<br><br></b></strong></H4><br><br>
 
 <H3 id="komal">Tower Bridge</H3><br><br>

<STRONG><B><H4 id="KOMAL1">Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London,<br><br>
 over the River Thames.<br><br> It is close to the Tower of London, which gives it its name and has become an iconic symbol of London.<br><br>
 Construction started in 1886 and took eight years to build.<br><br> The bridge consists of two towers which are tied together at the upper level<br><br>
 by means of two horizontal walkways which are designed <br><br>
 to withstand the forces of the suspended sections of the bridge..</strong></B></H4><br><br>
 
 <H3 id="komal">Traflaglar Square</H3><br><br>
 

 <center><img src="london33.jpg"></center><br><br>
<STRONG><B><H4 id="KOMAL1">Trafalgar Square is a large city square commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson’s victory against<br><br>
 Napoleon’s navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.<br><br> The central monument within the square is a single tall column on which the figure of Nelson<br><br>
 stands gazing over London.<br><br> His monument is surrounded by four colossal lions and a series of large fountains.<br><br>
 Much more than just an open plaza, Trafalgar Square is one of the most famous city squares<br><br>
 in the world and has become a social and political location for tourists and Londoners alike...<br><br></B></strong></H4><br><br>
