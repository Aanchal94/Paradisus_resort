<STRONG><b><H4 id="KOMAL1">The Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur were the world’s tallest buildings<br><br>
 before being surpassed in 2004 by Taipei 101.<br><br>
 However, the towers are still the tallest twin buildings in the world.<br><br>
 The 88-floor towers are constructed largely of reinforced concrete,<br><br>
 with a steel and glass facade designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art,<br><br>
 a reflection of Malaysia’s Muslim religion.<br><br> The Petronas Twin Towers feature a sky bridge between the two towers on the 41st and 42nd floors..<br><br></b></strong></H4><br><br>

<STRONG><B><H4 id="KOMAL1">The Perhentian Islands are a small group of beautiful,<br><br>
 coral-fringed islands off the coast of northeastern Malaysia, not far from the Thai border.<br><br>
 The two main islands are Perhentian Besar (“Big Perhentian”) and Perhentian Kecil (“Small Perhentian”).<br><br>
 Kecil attracts more travellers as it has cheaper accommodation,<br><br>
 while Besar is a little more expensive and caters more to families<br><br>
 and those who want to avoid the backpacker party scene..</strong></B></H4><br><br> 
 
 <H3 id="komal">Mount Kinabalu .</H3><br><br>

 The main peak of the mountain can be climbed easily by a person with a good physical condition,<br><br>
